                        <p>For our Classic Woodfire and Artisan Pro models, professional installation is recommended due to their weight and the need for a proper foundation. These models typically require concrete slabs and may need to comply with local building codes.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>For permanent installations, we recommend a reinforced concrete slab that extends at least 6 inches beyond the footprint of the oven in all directions. The slab should be at least 4-6 inches thick and properly cured before installation.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, our ovens can be installed on existing stone or concrete patios if they meet weight capacity requirements. For specific foundation recommendations based on your model and location, please consult with our installation team.</p>

                        <p>There are several ways to gauge your oven's temperature:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Infrared thermometer:</strong> The most accurate method, pointing a quality infrared thermometer at the cooking surface will give you precise temperature readings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual indicators:</strong> When properly heated, the soot on the dome will burn off, leaving it light in color. This typically indicates temperatures above 700°F.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flour test:</strong> Sprinkle a small amount of flour on the cooking surface. At optimal pizza temperatures (750-850°F), the flour should brown in about 10 seconds without burning immediately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Built-in thermometers:</strong> Some of our models feature built-in temperature gauges for easy monitoring.</li>

                        <p>Our ovens are built to withstand outdoor conditions and can be used year-round, though there are some considerations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Rain and snow:</strong> The ovens themselves are water-resistant, but we recommend using them under some form of shelter (pergola, awning, etc.) for comfort during inclement weather.</li>
                            <li><strong>Extreme cold:</strong> In sub-freezing temperatures, you may need longer heating times and more fuel to maintain proper cooking temperatures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Strong winds can affect flame patterns and temperature consistency. A windbreak or strategic placement can help mitigate these effects.</li>
                            <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity can impact cooking times slightly but won't damage the oven.</li>

                        <p>To prevent cracking in your woodfire oven, follow these best practices:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Proper curing:</strong> When first using your oven, follow the curing instructions carefully. This typically involves a series of small fires over several days to gradually dry out any moisture in the materials.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gradual heating:</strong> Always heat your oven gradually. Start with a small fire and slowly build it up over 30-45 minutes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protect from moisture:</strong> Use a cover when the oven is not in use to prevent water infiltration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoid thermal shock:</strong> Never pour water on hot surfaces or rapidly cool the oven.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintain the finish:</strong> Keep any exterior finishes in good repair to prevent water penetration.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Minor hairline cracks are normal in refractory materials and don't affect performance. If you notice larger cracks, contact our customer service for guidance.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The cooking surface (hearth) of your oven requires specific care:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clean with a natural fiber brush to remove food particles and ash after each use</li>
                            <li>For stuck-on food, wait until the oven cools, then lightly scrape with a wooden scraper</li>
                            <li>Never use water or cleaning chemicals on a hot cooking surface</li>
                            <li>If necessary, you can lightly dampen a cloth with water to wipe the surface when the oven is completely cool</li>
                            <li>The natural seasoning that develops over time improves cooking performance, so avoid deep cleaning unless absolutely necessary</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Over time, the cooking surface will develop a natural patina that enhances its non-stick properties and contributes to better heat distribution.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Remove any standing water using towels or a shop vacuum.</li>
                            <li>Allow the oven to air dry naturally for at least 24-48 hours with the door open.</li>
                            <li>Once the oven appears dry, conduct a gradual curing process:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Day 1: Build a very small fire and maintain it for 1-2 hours</li>
                                    <li>Day 2: Build a slightly larger fire for 2-3 hours</li>
                                    <li>Day 3: Normal fire for 3-4 hours</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This gradual approach allows moisture trapped in the refractory materials to escape slowly, preventing steam pressure and potential cracking. Never attempt to rapidly dry out a wet oven with a large fire.</p>
